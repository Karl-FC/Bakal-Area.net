## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of structural engineering, keeping up with the latest software technology can be challenging. This is especially true for students and traditional engineers who may struggle with the steep learning curve of sophisticated tools. To address this, we introduce AREA.net, a simple, beginner-friendly web-based application for steel member calculations.

## Description

AREA.net is designed to be a more accessible alternative to comprehensive design software like Bently's STAAD or Autodesk REVIT. It provides accurate and updated steel member calculations without requiring much expertise in programming or technology.

Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a minimalist user interface that prompts them to select the type of structural member and connection they wish to analyze. The site includes options for different kinds of beams and loads, making it easier to analyze a member's capacity. Users are also provided with a "learning" tab where they can learn or review the standards set by the AISC (The American Institute of Steel Construction), NSCP (National Structural Code of the Philippines), NBCP (National Building Code of the Philippines), and more.

## Features

AREA.net is equipped with a variety of features designed to make the process of structural analysis more accessible and efficient:

- **Beginner-friendly User Interface**: The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly input the necessary data and get the results they need without having to navigate through complicated menus or options.

- **Comprehensive Database**: AREA.net has a comprehensive database of different types of structural members and connections, ensuring that users can find the exact type of member or connection they need for their analysis.

- **Portability**: As a web-based application, AREA.net can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, enabling users to perform their structural analysis tasks on the go.

- **Learning Feature**: AREA.net is not just a tool, but also a learning platform. It includes a feature that helps users learn about the NSCP, NBCP, and AISC standards.

We hope that AREA.net will serve as a valuable tool for both students and professional engineers, helping to bridge the gap between traditional engineering practices and the latest software technology.
